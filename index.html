Dr. Shrikant Jichkar was an eminent educationist, an erudite politician, selfless social worker, a forceful orator, an eminent scholar and a crusader of Indian culture & tradition. He brought a whiff of culture & ethical tone to education. An Indian, proud of his heritage, he was well versed in Sanskrit, Upanishads, Geeta, Vedas & other sacred texts. A modern Shankaracharya who traversed far and wide explaining the glory of Indian heritage, his achievements are beyond labels and definitions. Dr. Jichkar's idea of school education was an all-round development & personality growth. He called 'SƒÅndipani', a new concept school for a new generation. According to him education is the 'way of life', giving maximum happiness to maximum number of people. This maxim he made the guiding philosophy of Sandipani. </p>
